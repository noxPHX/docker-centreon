# Docker Centreon üê≥
[Centreon](https://www.centreon.com/) is a network, system and application monitoring tool.

## Requirements üß∞
Only [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) are required, the following versions are the minimal requirements:

| Tool          | Version |
|:-------------:|:-------:|
| Docker        |  20.10  |
| Compose       |  1.29   |

*The container requires a kernel that supports cgroups v2, to ensure they are supported you can run and check the result of the following command: `grep cgroup2 /proc/filesystems`.*  
*More information about this in the dedicated section: []()*

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è
Fetch the code from the repository and enter the folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noxPHX/docker-centreon.git && cd docker-centreon
```

### SSL
The stack comes with a nginx container which needs a certificate and its private key as well as Diffie-Hellman parameters.

If needed, you can quickly generate a self-signed certificate as shown below:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout nginx/ssl/privkey.pem -out nginx/ssl/fullchain.pem -days 365 -subj '/CN=localhost' -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:pdns.local.intra,DNS:pihole.local.intra,IP:127.0.0.1,IP:0.0.0.0"
```

Regarding the D-H parameters you can generate them as follows:
```bash
openssl dhparam -out nginx/ssl/dhparams.pem 4096
```
*Depending on your machine, you might have time to grab a coffee* ‚òï

Finally, apply correct ownership (*www-data has id 33*)
```bash
chown -R $USER:33 nginx/ssl/
chmod 640 nginx/ssl/*.pem
```
*Compose does not support assigning ownership when mounting secrets.*

### Configuration
You can customize the timezone passed as a build argument in the Compose file *(l.7)*.  
Default value: `Europe/Amsterdam`.

### Build
To build the images, this simple Compose command will suffice: 
```bash
docker-compose build
```

### First setup
If you run Centreon for the first time, some additional setup is required, the following script will guide you through the installation of MariaDB.  
```bash
./setup.sh
```
Please set a secure root password and answer 'yes' to all questions, see the according [Centreon's documentation page](https://docs.centreon.com/docs/installation/installation-of-a-central-server/using-packages/#secure-the-database).  

You will then be required to complete the web installation, this is pretty straightforward, the [documentation page](https://docs.centreon.com/docs/installation/web-and-post-installation/#web-installation) may also help you.  
When asked to restart some services (step 9) you can simply run the following command: 
```bash
docker exec centreon-central systemctl restart cbd centengine gorgoned
```

### Start
To start the services, a convenient script is available, it helps setting up the cgroups filesystem in the container.  
```bash
./start.sh
```

## Notes
No sshd

## Docker, cgroups v2 ans SystemD
