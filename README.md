# Docker Centreon üê≥
[Centreon](https://www.centreon.com/) is a network, system and application monitoring tool.  
This repository will guide you through the installation of a Centreon Central server using Docker.  

## Requirements üß∞
Only [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) are required, the following versions are the minimal requirements:

| Tool          | Version |
|:-------------:|:-------:|
| Docker        |  20.10  |
| Compose       |  1.29   |

*The container requires a kernel that supports cgroups v2, to ensure they are supported you can run and check the result of the following command: `grep cgroup2 /proc/filesystems`.*  
*More information about this in the dedicated section: []()*

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è
Fetch the code from the repository and enter the folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noxPHX/docker-centreon.git && cd docker-centreon
```

### SSL
The stack comes with a nginx container which needs a certificate and its private key as well as Diffie-Hellman parameters.

If needed, you can quickly generate a self-signed certificate as shown below:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout nginx/ssl/privkey.pem -out nginx/ssl/fullchain.pem -days 365 -subj '/CN=localhost' -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:pdns.local.intra,DNS:pihole.local.intra,IP:127.0.0.1,IP:0.0.0.0"
```

Regarding the D-H parameters you can generate them as follows:
```bash
openssl dhparam -out nginx/ssl/dhparams.pem 4096
```
*Depending on your machine, you might have time to grab a coffee* ‚òï
